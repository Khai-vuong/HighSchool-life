				<p>As for me, staying up late is an exciting feeling. The habit was formed when I was in grade 8. On those days, when the nights come, I always feel sorrow and lonely. Therefore, I used music as a remedy for my soul. As a result, I stayed awake until 11h30 PM. Normally, I would sleep at 10h30 PM, however, I spent an extra hour chilling to the songs, to wash away all the heavy feelings. This (bad) habit is still kept until nowadays. Usually, I am sleepy from 9 PM to about 10h30 PM. But after that period, my consciousness is magically strengthened. I often spend my late nights listening to music, watching anime, playing games, or even dancing. The night not only makes me more sensitive to sensations but also boosts my productivity. In fact, reading novels, writing things, and coding become much more effective at that time. In addition, my creativity is enhanced significantly at late night. There was a time that I used to maintain awake until 1 or 2 AM to write the story plot for my game. Another thing is that I like the midnight’s tranquil ambiance, it helps my mind to easily activate the autobiography mode. Despite staying up late has tons of captivating benefits as mentioned, it also wreaks havoc on my physical health. By keeping myself awake for a long time (about 2 months), it drained all of my energy out. It destroyed my vision, made me a beast who constantly feeling asleep, sometimes even fainted. In the end, I have learned the harsh consequents of staying up late and decided to reduce the days of late-night enjoying.
